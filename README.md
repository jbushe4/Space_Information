**Space Exploration Analysis**

Through this analysis of space discoveries, I am hoping to show the importance of space exploration and how the advancements can have tangible benefits for society.

I collected this data from NASA and did exploritory anaysis to better understand the cis-lunar economy and how it has changed since NASA's inception. 
All of the data was in suitable form so there was no needed to clean. I only had to choose which variables would be useful in my analysis.

In the future, I am hoping to be able to better understand the privatization of space and how the changes in the industry will also impact the societal benefits. 
This hopefully will be able to add to the 'Space Discoveries" page and give a more holistic view.
